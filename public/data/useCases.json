Legacy email-based agreements meant compliance teams manually stitched every KYC document before storing it in regulated archives.\n\n## Solution\n- Render adaptive KYC forms with Sign Global's embedded components.\n- Trigger signer verification with selfie match when the risk engine flags high-value accounts.\n- Stream completed audit bundles to the compliance data lake with the evidence export API.\n\n## Outcomes\n**Reduced** customer drop-off by syncing reminders with the bank's CRM. _Improved_ compliance posture through immutable evidence manifests.",
